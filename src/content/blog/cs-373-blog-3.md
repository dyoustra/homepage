Back for week three!

## Reflecting on the past class week in CS 373

It seems to me that the pre-class quizzes have gotten more difficult and in-depth over the past week! Instead of answering class and language trivia/syntax questions, we're really starting to dive into actual control flow that we went over in the previous lecture or in the past project. The element of time pressure has begun to creep in, as is inevitable in a 4 minute long quiz. I think it's important to remember to review the notes before and after class to review and to solidify what we've just learned.

## On Teamwork

I pair programmed with a friend for a different class, Computer Graphics, after having read the paper on Continuous Integration, which talks a little bit about pair programming and how to work with a partner. It really is a skill. Often times in programming we can get so caught up with our way of things, how we want to program, how we look at the code and explore the codebase, and what is at the top of the todo agenda at any given time.

Pair Programming is really a challenge to any programmer, good or bad, experienced or green, to collaborate doing something that is so often a solitary task. After a first half hour of frustration at not driving and having to sit and watch as he navigated the code on his own, I tried to start again, and learned that there was a lot to gain as we discussed how to understand the math behind ray tracing within the specific context of our codebase, and how that differed from the priors from what we had learned in lecture. In the end, I ended up with a richer experience than I would have had, had we just worked separately or asynchronously.

## Pick-of-the-week

On recruitment... it's hard. Sometimes you just have to set out on a grind schedule for the week and try to fulfill yourself to prepare for the cycle of interviews and applications you'll have to send out.

For me, the NeetCode 150 has been helpful over the past month for helping me sharpen my technical interview skills and general DSA skills, without having to sift through the thousands of problems on LeetCode. Although I'm sure LeetCode and other whiteboard applications are plenty sufficient, I appreciate NeetCode's organization and simplicity.
