## Where did you grow up?

I grew up in Portola Valley, California. It's a small town of about 4,500 people in the San Francisco Bay Area of California. When people ask, I usually just tell them I live by Stanford (where I was also born)!

## What high school did you attend?

I attended Woodside Priory School, a Benedictine Catholic private high school in Portola Valley. It was quite small, my graduating class had only ~80 kids in it!

## What was your favorite extracurricular activity in high school?

I loved playing basketball. I probably should have continued it past sophomore year just because of all the fun it was staying fit and being with the team. I still play to this day though in intramurals at UT!

## Where would you have gone if UT hadn't accepted you?

I probably would have gone to the University of Maryland or the University of Wisconsin. I applied to a lot of schools and unfortunately did not recieve too many offers. But I suppose you only really need one!

## What would you have majored in if CS hadn't accepted you?

So many options. I'm a person who could be very happy doing so many different things. The first few things that come to mind...

- Electrical and Computer Engineering
- Mechanical Engineering
- Economics
- Chemistry
- History
- Math
- RTF!

## Why are you in this class?

This class seems like a good way to hone my programming and general software engineering skills. I think a lot of what I end up taking out of this class will be from doing the projects, as the topics listed on the syllabus look fairly familiar. But I figure this class will be a good way for me to ramp up my programming abilities and general industry knowledge bank before I begin full time job applications in the fall of my senior year.

## What are your expectations of this class?

I'm expecting this class to be an introduction to a lot of different topics around the world of modern industrial software engineering, without being able to go too deep into any one field. I hope that each project challenges me in a different, unique way, while still developing my overall software engineering technical skills.

In terms of difficulty/workload, other students around the department have told me that this course is fairly medium work-wise, especially considering the group projects. There's a lot of tasks to do in quantity, but nothing will be as hard as we encountered in OS.

## How much do you know about Javascript/Python/SQL/Web programming?

I think I know a fair bit, but I'm glad the class focuses a bit on Python and SQL. They're gaps in my knowledge bank that I've been meaning to fill and bolster for quite some time, and I think the lectures and projects in this class will help me do exactly that.

What I do know comes from my app startup, [NanoFlick](https://www.nanoflick.com/) (out on the App Store)! I've done a bunch of full-stack dev through that, with a lot of TypeScript files. However, our backend is Firebase Firestore, a NoSQL document-store backend that is... not great. For that reason, I'm especially excited to get to work with SQL in some projects.

I've done a lot of little web programming projects along the way, in addition to my experience with NanoFlick programming the website and some of its web tools/editors. React, RN, and especially Expo are great tools that I've used when creating web applications or web/mobile hybrid clients. Even this blog in itself was a little web project using Astro! [See the blog's GitHub page](https://github.com/dyoustra/homepage) for more technical detail.

## How did you like the first lectures?

I thought they were pretty good. I enjoyed the notes and how we moved around the linux shell and the python interpreter quite a bit to become familiar with them. I think, however, that Dr. Downing could increase the pace a bit of the lectures and cover more in a single 50 minute section. It seems like we've mostly been doing review from more basic CS courses, which is fine, but I'm excited to move on to the other parts of the syllabus!

Additionally, I think the project specs are fairly thorough. Maybe a quicker overview and some time for questions would help increase the pace rather than the full class period dedicated to introducing each project.

## How did you feel about the cold calling?

Seems fine to me. It seems people are worried about it though. I suppose that's the point, to get people to pay attention better. But I wonder if it would be better done on a smaller scale, as I think it slows down the pace of the lecture quite a bit, and doesn't invite as much free question and conversation.

## What made you happy this week?

I have an oil on canvas painting of the San Francisco skyline beside the golden gate bridge, and I was looking at it at night with my girlfriend in my newly moved into apartment. We had the LED lights on red, and you could really only see certain colors of the painting very well. It made me think about what a blessing it is to have a sun that emits white light. It illuminates the entire world, reflecting nature back to us in the full visible color spectrum. What a gift that is, to be given a star at the center of our solar system that, (not granted!) emits white light and allows us to easily see the most beautiful things in life in their full glory.

## What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

Ever played RollerCoaster Tycoon? Well I discovered yesterday on HackerNews that now Claude, the Anthropic AI Assistant, can too! My pick-of-the-week is this article and video by Jay Sobel: [We Put Claude Code in Rollercoaster Tycoon](https://labs.ramp.com/rct). It reveals insights into how to best optimize your development with Claude Code, knowing where it exceeds and where it struggles, and how to optimize your development to best prevent these AI-caused setbacks.
